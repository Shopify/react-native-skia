/**
 * Skia API objects are implemented with the JSI NativeState pattern: plain JS
 * objects with a shared prototype and native state attached. Worklets cannot
 * serialize such objects by default (the prototype would be lost when moving
 * them to another runtime), so we register a Custom Serializable that:
 *
 * - determine: detects Skia objects via the `__box` method installed on every
 *   Skia prototype (plain objects never reach the custom-serializable path,
 *   so this cannot misfire on user data).
 * - pack: boxes the object into a HostObject wrapper that carries the native
 *   state and the class brand. HostObjects are transferred by reference.
 * - unpack: unboxes on the target runtime, re-installing the class prototype
 *   there and re-attaching the same native state.
 *
 * This mirrors the box/unbox pattern used by the WebGPU bindings.
 *
 * `react-native-worklets` (Reanimated 4) is required for this to work —
 * without it, Skia objects cannot be captured in worklets or stored in shared
 * values.
