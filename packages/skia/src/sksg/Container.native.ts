/**
 * Records the scene graph on the JS thread and hands the native recorder to
 * the view, which owns it and replays it on every draw. The Reanimated mapper
 * only pushes the shared values into that recorder through the view id: no
 * Skia object is captured by a worklet, so nothing on the UI runtime holds
 * native memory. The JS wrapper is disposed right after the handoff, so the
 * view is the sole owner and the resources referenced by the recording
 * (images, pictures) are released when the view replaces it or is torn down,
 * not when a garbage collector gets around to a wrapper.
 *
 * Unmounting does not clear the view: the native view can outlive the React
 * tree (exit animations, screen transitions) and keeps showing its last frame
 * until it is torn down, which is when the recording is released.
