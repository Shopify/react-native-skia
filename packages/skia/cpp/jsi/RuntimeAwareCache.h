/**
 * Provides a way to keep data specific to a jsi::Runtime instance that gets
 * cleaned up when that runtime is destroyed. This is necessary because JSI does
 * not allow for its associated objects to be retained past the runtime
 * lifetime. If an object (e.g. jsi::Values or jsi::Function instances) is kept
 * after the runtime is torn down, its destructor (once it is destroyed
 * eventually) will result in a crash (JSI objects keep a pointer to memory
 * managed by the runtime, accessing that portion of the memory after runtime is
 * deleted is the root cause of that crash).
 *
 * In order to provide an efficient implementation that does not add an overhead
 * for the cases when only a single runtiome is used, which is the primary
 * usecase, the following assumption has been made: Only for secondary runtimes
 * we track destruction and clean up the store associated with that runtime. For
 * the first runtime we assume that the object holding the store is destroyed
 * prior to the destruction of that runtime.
 *
 * The above assumption makes it work without any overhead when only single
 * runtime is in use. Specifically, we don't perform any additional operations
 * related to tracking runtime lifecycle when only a single runtime is used.
