 * Records the declarative content of a SkiaGraphiteView (a Recorder handed
 * over by <GraphiteCanvas>, or a picture) into Graphite recordings, on the
 * render thread pool.
 *
 * Three threads meet here. The JS thread hands over the content. A Reanimated
 * mapper, on the UI runtime, reads the shared values into the recorder's
 * pending writes: that is the only step that needs a JS runtime, and it never
 * waits for a replay. A pool thread replays the commands (the recorder writes
 * the pending values into them first) into a deferred canvas of the view's
 * target and submits the recording; the main thread presents it on the next
 * vsync.
 *
 * Pacing: a view has at most one job in flight and at most one recording
 * waiting to be presented. Updates that arrive meanwhile only mark the content
 * dirty; the next presented frame starts the next job. A producer that
 * outruns the display therefore records once per vsync, and the queue of the
 * target never grows.
