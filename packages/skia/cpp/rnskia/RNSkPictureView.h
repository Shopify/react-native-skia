 * renderer, not by a JS wrapper: its commands hold every native resource the
 * canvas draws (images, pictures, paths), and tying their lifetime to the
 * garbage collector of a runtime that rarely allocates (the UI runtime) kept
 * them resident long after unmount. Here they are released as soon as the
 * recorder is replaced, or when the host view is torn down (see clear()).
 *
 * Threading: setPicture/setRecorder run on the JS thread (React commit),
 * applyUpdates on the UI thread (Reanimated mapper), drawInto on the main
 * thread (onscreen draws) or the JS thread (snapshots). _mutex only guards
 * the two pointers, so a commit never waits for a draw; the recorder
 * serializes its replay against its updates on its own.
