`SkiaGraphiteView` is a canvas for the [Graphite backend](/docs/getting-started/installation#graphite) that you drive frame by frame from any JavaScript runtime.
A frame is a Graphite recording: you record it on the thread you are on (the JS thread, the Reanimated UI runtime or a dedicated worklet runtime), and the view presents it on the next display frame.

:::info

The view requires the Graphite backend. On the default backend and on the web it renders nothing, and `getContext()` throws.

## Recording a frame

The view's ref gives access to its recording context once the view is mounted.
The context knows the size of the view in points and produces one recording at a time.

```tsx
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import { Skia, SkiaGraphiteView } from "@shopify/react-native-skia";
import type { SkiaGraphiteViewRef } from "@shopify/react-native-skia";

export const Demo = () => {
  const ref = useRef<SkiaGraphiteViewRef>(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    const ctx = ref.current!.getContext();
    const paint = Skia.Paint();
    paint.setColor(Skia.Color("cyan"));
    const canvas = ctx.beginRecording();
    // The canvas starts with whatever the view shows: clear it first.
    canvas.clear(Skia.Color("black"));
    canvas.drawCircle(ctx.width / 2, ctx.height / 2, 64, paint);
    ctx.submit(ctx.finishRecording());
  }, []);
  return <SkiaGraphiteView ref={ref} style={{ flex: 1 }} />;
};
```

`beginRecording()` returns a canvas in points that is valid until `finishRecording()`.
`finishRecording()` returns the recording, and `submit()` queues it for the next frame.
A recording is immutable: you can submit the same one again later without recording it again, which is convenient for static content.

## Threading model

Recording happens on the thread that calls `beginRecording()`, presenting on the main thread, aligned with the display link (`CADisplayLink` on iOS, the `Choreographer` on Android).
The context can be captured into a worklet, so a frame loop can run on the Reanimated UI runtime without touching the JS thread:

```tsx
import { useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import { useFrameCallback, useSharedValue } from "react-native-reanimated";
import { Skia, SkiaGraphiteView } from "@shopify/react-native-skia";
import type { SkGraphiteContext, SkiaGraphiteViewRef } from "@shopify/react-native-skia";

export const Demo = () => {
  const ref = useRef<SkiaGraphiteViewRef>(null);
  const ctx = useSharedValue<SkGraphiteContext | null>(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    ctx.value = ref.current!.getContext();
  }, [ctx]);
  useFrameCallback((frame) => {
    "worklet";
    if (!ctx.value) {
      return;
    }
    const canvas = ctx.value.beginRecording();
    canvas.clear(Skia.Color("black"));
    const paint = Skia.Paint();
    paint.setColor(Skia.Color("cyan"));
    const t = frame.timestamp / 1000;
    canvas.drawCircle(ctx.value.width / 2 + Math.cos(t) * 100, ctx.value.height / 2, 64, paint);
    ctx.value.submit(ctx.value.finishRecording());
  });
  return <SkiaGraphiteView ref={ref} style={{ flex: 1 }} />;
};
```

A few rules follow from this model:

- One recording is open at a time per view. Finish it before starting the next one, on any runtime.
- Recordings are presented in submission order and never dropped. A later frame may sample a texture an earlier frame uploaded, so when the main thread falls behind, the queued frames are replayed in order and only the last one stays visible.
- The producer clears the canvas. A recording draws on top of what the view shows, which also lets you record only the parts that changed.
- GPU-backed images (offscreen surface snapshots, native buffers, video frames) can be drawn from any runtime. Their content is uploaded when they are created, so create them before the frame that uses them.

## Snapshots

`makeImageSnapshot()` and `makeImageSnapshotAsync()` from `SkiaViewApi` replay the current frame into an offscreen surface, like they do for a `Canvas`.
