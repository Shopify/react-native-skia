React Native Skia provides an integration with Reanimated 3 that allows for animations
to be executed on the UI-thread. 

This integration is available with [Reanimated v3 or higher](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-reanimated/docs/fundamentals/installation). If you are using Reanimated 2, [see Reanimated 2 support](#reanimated-2).

## Hello World

React Native Skia accepts Reanimated shared and derived values directly as properties.
It is as simple as that.

```tsx twoslash
import {useEffect} from "react";
import {Canvas, Circle, Group} from "@shopify/react-native-skia";
import {
  useDerivedValue,
  useSharedValue,
  withRepeat,
  withTiming,
} from "react-native-reanimated";

export const HelloWorld = () => {
  const size = 256;
  const r = useSharedValue(0);
  const c = useDerivedValue(() => size - r.value);
  useEffect(() => {
    r.value = withRepeat(withTiming(size * 0.33, { duration: 1000 }), -1);
  }, [r, size]);
  return (
    <Canvas style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Group blendMode="multiply">
        <Circle cx={r} cy={r} r={r} color="cyan" />
        <Circle cx={c} cy={r} r={r} color="magenta" />
        <Circle
          cx={size/2}
          cy={c}
          r={r}
          color="yellow"
        />
      </Group>
    </Canvas>
  );
};
```

## Gesture Handler

This allows you to integrate with any library that supports Reanimated.
[React native Gesture Handler](https://docs.swmansion.com/react-native-gesture-handler/docs/) for instance.

```tsx twoslash
import { useWindowDimensions } from "react-native";
import { Canvas, Circle, Fill } from "@shopify/react-native-skia";
import { GestureDetector, Gesture } from "react-native-gesture-handler";

import { useSharedValue, withDecay } from "react-native-reanimated";


export const AnimationWithTouchHandler = () => {
  const { width } = useWindowDimensions();
  const leftBoundary = 0;
  const rightBoundary = width;
  const translateX = useSharedValue(width / 2);

  const gesture = Gesture.Pan()
    .onChange((e) => {
      translateX.value += e.changeX;
    })
    .onEnd((e) => {
      translateX.value = withDecay({
        velocity: e.velocityX,
        clamp: [leftBoundary, rightBoundary],
      });
    });

  return (
    <GestureDetector gesture={gesture}>
      <Canvas style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <Fill color="white" />
        <Circle cx={translateX} cy={40} r={20} color="#3E3E" />
      </Canvas>
    </GestureDetector>
  );
};
```

## Element Tracking

A common use-case is to have gestures only activate the gesture for a particular element on the Canvas.
Gesture Handler is really good at that because it can take into account all the transformations applied to an element (translations, scaling, rotations).
For each element you would like to track, simply overlay an animated view onto which you apply the exact same transformations than the one you apply to your canvas element.

In the example below, each circle is track separately by two gesture handlers.

```tsx
import { View } from "react-native";
import { Canvas, Circle, Fill } from "@shopify/react-native-skia";
import { GestureDetector, Gesture } from "react-native-gesture-handler";

import Animated, { useSharedValue, useAnimatedStyle } from "react-native-reanimated";

const radius = 30;

export const ElementTracking = () => {
  // The position of the ball
  const x = useSharedValue(100);
  const y = useSharedValue(100);
  // This is the style we will apply to the "invisible" animated view
  // that will overlay the ball
  const style = useAnimatedStyle(() => ({
    position: "absolute",
    top: -radius,
    left: -radius,
    width: radius * 2,
    height: radius * 2,
    transform: [{ translateX: x.value }, { translateY: y.value }],
  }));
  // The gesture handler for the ball
  const gesture = Gesture.Pan().onChange((e) => {
    x.value += e.x;
    y.value += e.y;
  });
  return (
    <View style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Canvas style={{ flex: 1 }}>
        <Fill color="white" />
        <Circle cx={x} cy={y} r={radius} color="cyan" />
      </Canvas>
      <GestureDetector gesture={gesture}>
        <Animated.View style={style} />
      </GestureDetector>
    </View>
  );
};
```

## Reanimated 2

If you are using Reanimated 2, we offer a hook named `useSharedValueEffect` where you can update Skia values when Reanimated values are updated.

:::info

useSharedValueEffect() runs on the JS thread. We suggest using Reanimated 3 if possible, [see Reanimated 3 support](/docs/animations/reanimated).

:::


### Example

In the example below we are running a Reanimated animation on the shared value named progress - and then we have callback invoked on any shared value change thanks to the useSharedValueEffect hook:

```tsx twoslash
import {useEffect} from "react";
import {Canvas, Rect, mix, useSharedValueEffect, useValue} from "@shopify/react-native-skia";
import {useSharedValue, withRepeat, withTiming} from "react-native-reanimated";

const MyComponent = () => {
  const x = useValue(0);
  const progress = useSharedValue(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    progress.value = withRepeat(withTiming(1, { duration: 3000 }), -1, true);
  }, [progress]);

  useSharedValueEffect(() => {
    x.current = mix(progress.value, 0, 100);
  }, progress); // you can pass other shared values as extra parameters

  return (
    <Canvas style={{ flex: 1 }}>
      <Rect
        x={x}
        y={100}
        width={10}
        height={10}
        color="red"
      />
    </Canvas>
  );
};
```
