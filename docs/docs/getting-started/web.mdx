import {Snack} from '@site/src/components/Snack';

React Native Skia runs in a web browser thanks to [CanvasKit](https://skia.org/docs/user/modules/canvaskit/), a WebAssembly build of Skia.
The WebAssembly file is loaded asynchronously and has a size of 2.9MB gzipped.
While this is a substantial file size, you have control over the user experience: you can decide when to load Skia and how the loading experience should be.

We provide direct integrations with [Expo](#expo) and [Remotion](#remotion).
Below you will also find the manual installation steps to run the module on any React Native Web projects.

You can use React Native Skia without React Native Web.

## Expo

Using React Native Skia on Expo Web is reasonably straightforward.

We provide a script named `setup-skia-web` that will copy the `canvaskit.wasm` so it is accessible from the public folder of your Expo project:
If you are [loading CanvasKit from a CDN](#using-a-cdn), you don't need to run the `setup-skia-web` script.
```bash
$ npx expo install @shopify/react-native-skia
$ yarn setup-skia-web
```

:::info

You need to run `yarn setup-skia-web` everytime you upgrade `@shopify/react-native-skia`.
Consider adding it to your `postinstall` script.

:::

Once you are done, you need to pick your strategy to [Load Skia](#loading-skia).

### Expo Router

If you have a project with Expo Router running already, you can either use the [code-splitting](#using-code-splitting) method, or [deferred component registration](#using-deferred-component-registration).

To use deferred component registration on Expo Router, you need to create a new entry script and link to it from your `package.json`.
Say we've created a `index.js` and `index.web.js` file in our `src/` folder, our `package.json` will update to match:
```json
{
  "main": "src/index",
  // rest of your package.json file
}
```

And here's the `src/index.web.js` code example:

```tsx
import '@expo/metro-runtime';
import { App } from 'expo-router/build/qualified-entry';
import { renderRootComponent } from 'expo-router/build/renderRootComponent';

import { LoadSkiaWeb } from '@shopify/react-native-skia/lib/module/web';

LoadSkiaWeb({
  locateFile: (file) => `/js/${file}`,
}).then(async () => {
  renderRootComponent(App);
});
```

You can adapt it to [load the CanvasKit WASM from a CDN](#using-a-cdn) if you wish.
For `src/index.js`, you can call `renderRootComponent(App)` directly.

### Snack

To use React Native Skia on [snack](https://snack.expo.dev/), you will need to use [code-splitting](#using-code-splitting) method.

<Snack id="@wcandillon/hello-snack" />

## Remotion

To use React Native Skia with Remotion, please follow [the following installation steps](https://remotion.dev/skia).

## Manual Webpack Installation

To run React Native Skia on Web with Webpack, you need to do three things:

- Make sure that the WebAssembly file is available from the build system.
- Configure the build system to resolve the following two node modules: `fs` and `path`. One way to do it is to use the [node polyfill plugin](https://www.npmjs.com/package/node-polyfill-webpack-plugin).
- If you are not using the `react-native-reanimated`, Webpack will throw a warning since React Native Skia refers to that module.

So following is an example of a Webpack v5 configuration that supports React Native Skia.
These three steps can easily be adapted to your build system.

```tsx
import fs from "fs";
import { sources } from "webpack";
import NodePolyfillPlugin from "node-polyfill-webpack-plugin";

const newConfiguration = {
  ...currentConfiguration,
  plugins: [
    ...currentConfiguration.plugins,
    // 1. Make the wasm file available to the build system
    new (class CopySkiaPlugin {
      apply(compiler) {
        compiler.hooks.thisCompilation.tap("AddSkiaPlugin", (compilation) => {
          compilation.hooks.processAssets.tapPromise(
            {
              name: "copy-skia",
              stage:
                compiler.webpack.Compilation.PROCESS_ASSETS_STAGE_ADDITIONAL,
            },
            async () => {
              const src = require.resolve(
                "canvaskit-wasm/bin/full/canvaskit.wasm"
              );
              if (compilation.getAsset(src)) {
                // Skip emitting the asset again because it's immutable
                return;
              }

              compilation.emitAsset(
                "/canvaskit.wasm",
                new sources.RawSource(await fs.promises.readFile(src))
              );
            }
          );
        });
      }
    })(),
    // 2. Polyfill fs and path module from node
    new NodePolyfillPlugin()
  ],
  externals: {
    ...currentConfiguration.externals,
    // 3. Avoid warning if reanimated is not present
    "react-native-reanimated": "require('react-native-reanimated')",
    "react-native-reanimated/package.json":
      "require('react-native-reanimated/package.json')",
  },
}
```

Last, you need to [load Skia](#loading-skia).

## Loading Skia

You need to have Skia fully loaded and initialized before importing the Skia module.
There are two ways you can control the way Skia should load:
* With `<WithSkiaWeb />`: using code-splitting to defer loading the components that import Skia.
* With `LoadSkiaWeb()`: deferring the root component registration until Skia is loaded.

### Using Code-Splitting

We provide a `<WithSkiaWeb>` component which leverages [code splitting](https://reactjs.org/docs/code-splitting.html). In the example below, we load Skia before loading the `MySkiaComponent` component. 

```tsx
import React from 'react';
import { Text } from "react-native";
// Notice the import path `@shopify/react-native-skia/lib/module/web`
// This is important only to pull the code responsible for loading Skia.
// @ts-expect-error
import { WithSkiaWeb } from "@shopify/react-native-skia/lib/module/web";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <WithSkiaWeb
      getComponent={() => import("./MySkiaComponent")}
      fallback={<Text>Loading Skia...</Text>}
    />
  );
}
```

### Using Deferred Component Registration

We provide a `LoadSkiaWeb()` function you can use to load Skia before starting the React app.
This is the approach we use for Remotion, for instance.
The following is an example of an `index.web.js` file.

```tsx
// Notice the import path `@shopify/react-native-skia/lib/module/web`
// This is important only to pull the code responsible for loading Skia.
// @ts-expect-error
import { LoadSkiaWeb } from "@shopify/react-native-skia/lib/module/web";

LoadSkiaWeb().then(async () => {
  const App = (await import("./src/App")).default;
  AppRegistry.registerComponent("Example", () => App);
});
```

## Using a CDN

Another option is to load CanvasKit from a CDN.
This is useful to load Skia Web without having to modify your build steps.
It is imperative that you are using the exact same version of CanvasKit as the one used by React Native Skia.

In the example below we load CanvasKit from a CDN using code-splitting.

```tsx
import { WithSkiaWeb } from "@shopify/react-native-skia/lib/module/web";
import { version } from 'canvaskit-wasm/package.json';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <WithSkiaWeb
      opts={{ locateFile: (file) => `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/canvaskit-wasm@${version}/bin/full/${file}` }}
      getComponent={() => import("./MySkiaComponent")}
  );
}
```

Below is the same example but using deferred component registration.
 
 ```tsx
import { LoadSkiaWeb } from "@shopify/react-native-skia/lib/module/web";
import { version } from 'canvaskit-wasm/package.json';

LoadSkiaWeb({
  locateFile: (file) => `https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/canvaskit-wasm@${version}/bin/full/${file}`
}).then(async () => {
  const App = (await import("./src/App")).default;
  AppRegistry.registerComponent("Example", () => App);
});
```
